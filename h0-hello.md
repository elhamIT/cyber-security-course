# h0 - Hello   

Welcome to my **Cyber Security Course Homework Reports** page!  

This is the voluntary homework which I create a GitHub Markdown page and I’ll add notes, and some code style.  

## Introduction  

In this course, I'll learn cyber security and understand high level management view. There will be some hands-on exercises.

Cybersecurity is about protecting:  **Data**, **Systems**, **Networks** 

**_“Passwords are like underwear: don’t let people see it, change it very often, and you shouldn’t share it with strangers.”_ – Chris Pirillo** 

## Simple Example Code  

Here is an example code for hashing a password using Python:  

```python
import hashlib  

password = "mypassword"  
hashed = hashlib.sha256(password.encode()).hexdigest()  
print(hashed)
