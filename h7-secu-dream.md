# h7 SecuDream™, Cyber Security Course of My Dreams

SecuDream™ is a cybersecurity course designed entirely for my own interests and learning goals.  
It focuses on **practical, realistic, developer-friendly security**, with an emphasis on  
API security, secure software development, DevSecOps mindset, and understanding real threats  
without needing overly complex hands-on labs.

## Course Goals

After completing SecuDream™, the student…

1. **Understands how modern cyber attacks work** (at a conceptual and practical level).  
2. **Can securely develop and maintain applications**, especially APIs and cloud-connected systems.  
3. **Recognizes the importance of secret management, authentication, and secure defaults** in software.  
4. **Understands organizational cybersecurity**: maturity models, risk thinking, and communication across teams.  
5. **Feels confident discussing security issues** with developers, managers, and non-technical stakeholders.

## Course Agenda (Themes per Session)

### **1. Cybersecurity Today: Threat Landscape & Mindset**
- Realistic overview of attacks affecting companies today  
- Why cyber matters for software developers  
- Thinking like an attacker vs defender  

### **2. Secure Software Development Basics**

- Secure coding principles, code reviews, input validation  

### **3. API Security 101**
- What can go wrong in REST APIs  
- Authentication, authorization, tokens, JWT  
- Why **never hard-code secrets**  

### **4. Secret Management for Developers**

### **6. Cloud Security Fundamentals**
- How cloud misconfigurations lead to breaches  
- Identity and access control in the cloud  

### **7. Organizational Security & Cyber Maturity**
- Simple frameworks (NIST CSF, Kybermittari)  
- How to evaluate an organization's strengths and weaknesses  
- Incident response basics  

### **8. Social Engineering & Human Factors**
- Why humans remain the #1 attack vector  
- Analysis of phishing, scams, fraud, and deception  

### **9. Group Case: “Breach Simulation”**
- Students work in small teams to analyze a fictional breach scenario  
- Identify root causes, impacts, and prevention measures  
- Group presentation of findings  

### **10. Final Session: Bringing It All Together**
- Build a personal “Security Improvement Plan”  
- Discussion: how to continue security learning in real life  


## Exercises & Learning Activities

This course avoids heavy technical complexity and instead focuses on **practical understanding**  
and **discussion-based learning**.

### Types of exercises:

- **Guided class discussions**
  - “What should a secure API look like?”  
  - “How would a small company defend against phishing?”  

- **Group analysis sessions**
  - Solve a fictional incident as a team  
  - Evaluate an organization using a light maturity model  

- **Mini hands-on demos (teacher-led)**
  - Viewing secrets leaked in a Git repo  
  - Demonstration of insecure vs secure API endpoints  

- **Short written reflections**
  - Summaries of a security podcast, blog, or article  
  - “What did I learn from today’s topic?”  

- **Design tasks**
  - Create a simple secure architecture for an app  
  - Draft a security checklist for developers  

### Optional practicals
(Not required to complete technically, but explained and demonstrated.)

- Why and how port scanning works  
- What password hashing means  
- GitHub secret scanning examples  


## Special Guest(s) and Excursions

In my dream course, we would invite **guest speakers** who can explain complex topics in a  
practical, inspiring way — especially those known in Finland for cyber and secure development.

### Possible guest speakers:
- **Mikko Hyppönen** — (F-Secure / WithSecure) on global threat landscape  
- **Laura Kankaala** — (Hack the TV) practical hacking stories and Q&A  
- **Juho Juntunen** — Finnish cloud security speaker  
- Experienced **DevSecOps engineer** from a Finnish tech company  
- Someone from **Traficom / NCSC-FI** on incident trends in Finland  

### Special event idea:
- **Visit to NCSC-FI (Kyberturvallisuuskeskus)**  
  - Learn how national-level incident response works  
- **Mini cyber escape room**  
  - Solve small puzzles around secrets, phishing, and misconfigurations  


## Rationale for My Choices

- I am a **software developer**, so my dream course focuses on **practical development security**  
  rather than deep offensive hacking or complex forensics.
- I want to understand **realistic threats** without needing to build large lab environments.
- Secret management, API security, and DevSecOps automation feel extremely relevant to  
  modern software teams — and highly applicable in my future work.
- I enjoy learning through **discussion, case analysis, and demonstrations**,  
  rather than purely technical CTF challenges.
- Understanding **organizational maturity and communication** helps bridge gaps between  
  developers, security, and business — which is essential in real workplaces.


## Summary

SecuDream™ is a course designed for **modern developers and future security-conscious engineers**.  
It balances conceptual understanding, realistic case work, guided demos, and high-quality discussions  
with guest speakers who bring real-world experience.  

The course aims to make cybersecurity **practical, understandable, and useful**,  
especially for people who want to improve software security without becoming full-time hackers.
