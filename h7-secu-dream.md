# h7 SecuDream, Cyber Security Course of My Dreams

## Goals

The main goals after the course, are that now me as a student:

* can **secure a small web application** using basic best practices (external secrets, authentication, scanning)
* understands **core offensive and defensive tools** (nmap, hashcat, feed monitoring, OSINT)
* can **assess organizational security maturity** using a practical framework (e.g. Kybermittari)
* can **explain security concepts to non-specialists** using plain language and examples


## Outline / Agenda (themes per session)
We covered different kind of themes on each session, here is the summary of the themes we have gone through and learnt:

1. **Overview of current security scene**

2. **Cyber Reality Check**  
   - Threat landscape, feed readers, podcast and blog summaries

3. **Linux for Security**  
   - Installing Debian in VM, and command line basics

4. **Port Scanning**  
   - nmap on localhost and discovering services

5. **Passwords & Cracking**  
   - Hashes, hashcat, password policies

6. **Encryption & Password Management**  

7. **Cybermaturity Workshop**  
   - Kybermittari


## Exercises

The course covered different types of exercises, from both theoritical and practical aspects. The variety of the exercises were as follows:

* **Hands-on Labs Experience**
  - Running port scans in VM
  - Cracking demo password hashes with hashcat

* **Written Reflections**
  - Listening to security related Podcasts, reading blog posts about it, finding academic article and trying to connect them to each other
  - Making security improvement plan for a small organization

* **Group Work**
  - Kybermittari maturity discussion with multiple roles in a group work
  - Discussion about how getting news about cyber security and feeds in a group

* **Encryption & Password Management**
  - Encrypting a message using PGP
  - Importance of using password management like KeePassXC

## Models and Frameworks

* **OWASP Top 10**: practical web risks
* **Kybermittari / Cybermeter**: rapid maturity assessment
* **NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF)**: Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond and Recover
* **CIS Controls**: prioritised security controls for small organizations
* **OWASP Cheat Sheet Series**: short practical rules for real devs

## Visiting Lecturers & Special Events

Throughout the course, several lectures and special sessions enriched the learning experience. A few highlights:

### **Week 44: Security in Cloud & Modern Threats**  
* Introduction to **Google Cloud security**  
* Overview of **current cyber threats and business impact**  
* **Passwordless authentication** and modern identity methods

### **Week 45: SOC Operations & Secure Web Development**  
* End-user security from a **SOC analyst’s perspective**  
* Managing cybersecurity risks in **web application development**

### **Week 46: Auth, DevSecOps & DDoS Attacks**  
* Authentication basics and cryptographic hashing  
* **DevSecOps** and integrating security in the pipeline  
* Real-world case of **Mirai botnet and DDoS**

### **Week 47: Business Continuity & Social Engineering**  
* Social engineering case: **draining bank accounts with lies**  
* Cloud backup and recovery for **business continuity**

### **Week 48: Security Maturity & Procurement**  
* Cyber security considerations in **SaaS procurement**  
* Fundamentals of **network firewalls and tunneling**

### **Week 49: Network Security, API Security & Cryptocurrencies**  
* Underlay and overlay **network security**  
* Student presentation: **Stop Hard-Coding Secrets — Practical API Security in Spring Boot**  
* Overview of **cryptocurrencies and security implications**

These sessions combined technical knowledge with management, cloud, DevSecOps, continuity, and real-world cases, which is the exact combination that inspired the design of SecuDream.

## What I Learned from the Lectures

Across the different weeks, the lectures showed how **broad, practical, and interconnected** cybersecurity really is.

### **Cloud Security & Modern Threats**
I learned how cloud environments shift security towards identity, configuration, and continuous monitoring. Threats impact not only systems but also business reputation and continuity.

### **SOC & Secure Web Development**
Seeing security from a SOC perspective helped me understand day-to-day defense. The web development talk connected directly to my developer background: secure defaults and correct secret handling matter more than I realized.

### **Authentication, DevSecOps & DDoS**
Foundational concepts like hashing became clearer, and DevSecOps showed how automation brings security into daily development. The Mirai case demonstrated how small weaknesses can scale into large global attacks.

### **Business Continuity & Social Engineering**
These sessions highlighted the human factor, how social engineering bypasses all technical controls. Backup and recovery are business-level survival skills, not just IT tasks.

### **Security Maturity & Procurement**
I learned how to evaluate SaaS vendors and why procurement is a critical part of cyber resilience. This tied nicely to the Kybermittari maturity work.

### **Network Security, API Security & Cryptocurrencies**
The final lectures showed how application, network, and financial technologies intersect. My own API security presentation reinforced how even small developer habits influence organizational security.

## Rationale

I am a Software Developer, so I want realistic developer-oriented security tasks
* Debian VM labs make risks **real but safe**
* Kybermittari connects **technical issues with management language**
* I believe the future of cyber is in:
  - DevSecOps automation  
  - API security  
  - Supply chain security (Git, dependencies, CI)

## Think Outside the Box

* **Live Red vs Blue Game**  
  Two teams: attackers and defenders, with post-mortem discussion

* **Simulated Breach Day**  
  Roleplay: CIO, helpdesk, incident responder, PR

* **AI Assistant for Cyber Training**  
  Personalized labs, instant feedback on configuration files

So, Budget: unlimited. Creativity: encouraged.
